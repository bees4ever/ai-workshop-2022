# Capgemini AI Workshop / Crime Detection with YOLO

Welcome to our AI Workshop with YOLO. We hope will have some possibilities to learn something new and also have fun. The Workshop is structured that you will have several task to solve. There is a warm up task and then each task has a given szenario which guides you to the task and helps to understand what we want you to solve.

Each task has it's dataset, which you easily can download and work with.

### The Scope

In general the workshop is about Object Detection. The provided dataset contains surveilance camera snapshots froma shopping mall. Mainly the images contains a crowd of people and everything else visible in a corridor between different shops like a bank where people sit and everything related. Now, the idea is in general for eacht task to find a suspcicoius person which cold be the thief. 


### Get Started

We will now present the task description and a prepared colab notebook. For the coding part `python` knowledge is required. The colabs are prepared so that you only would need to do a small part to solve the task. But this is of course the main part. Data loading + preparation has been done by us, as you will see.

The last task will be the hardest. You will be asked to finetune an own YOLO model. The dataset is prepared as data labeling takes enourmous time. More details can be found inthe specific Colab notebook.

*To get started:* Please open the colabs and save it in your account so that your changes will be saved actually.
